                        <p>Normally, clothes are considered a benefit where employer tax should be paid. The

                                <li>
                                    <p>Uniforms</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Specialized clothing for a specific profession (hospital, food service, restaurant)</p>

                        <p>Clothes that can be used privately may in some cases be tax-free, however, the clothing must be:</p>

                        <h2>Company Car</h2>
                        <p>If the company's car is used privately more than 10 times or more
                            than 100 kilometers per year, it is considered a benefit and tax must be paid on the
                            benefit value. Journeys to and from work count as private.</p>

                        <h3>Benefit Value</h3>
                        <p>The benefit value is influenced by many factors:</p>
                        <ul class="deduct-list">
                            <li>
                                <p>The car's new price</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Extra equipment</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>If the car is an environmental car</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>If the employee drives at least 30,000 kilometers for service</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Vehicle tax</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            To find out the car's benefit value, you can use the Swedish Tax Agency's e-service:
                            <a class="long-url" href="https://www7.skatteverket.se/portal/bilformansberakning/"
                                target="_blank">Car Benefit Swedish Tax Agency</a>
                        </p>

                        <h3>Fuel, Congestion Tax, Parking</h3>
                <p>Fuel and congestion tax on private rides should be considered a benefit and tax must be paid.
                    The benefit value on fuel should be multiplied by 1.2.<i> Example: if the company has paid 1000
                        SEK for fuel, the benefit value is 1200 SEK (1.2*1000).</i></p>
                <p>
                    Regarding parking with a company car, it depends on whether the parking spot/garage is at the
                    business or at the residence. At the business, it counts as a tax-free benefit, otherwise, tax
                    must be paid.
                </p>

                <h3>Tax</h3>
                <p>How much tax should be paid on the benefit value? The benefit value is calculated as a salary if
                    it is an employee who utilizes the benefit, hence the company must pay employer contributions
                    and the individual utilizing the benefit must pay tax. Normally, employer contributions are
                    31.42% depending on age, and the tax is about 30% depending on the municipality.</p>
                <p>If the benefit is utilized by a sole trader (enskild näringsverksamhet), the benefit instead counts
                    as revenue and
                    should be taxed accordingly.</p>

                        <h2>Gifts</h2>
                <p>Generally, gifts are taxable, where benefit taxation applies and VAT cannot be deducted.
                    However, there are some exceptions that we will go through.</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Tax-free gifts apply to employees. If you are a sole trader (enskild näringsverksamhet), you
                                cannot give
                                yourself a tax-free gift, but you can give gifts to employees. If you run a
                                limited liability company (aktiebolag) and are employee, you can give yourself a tax-free
                                gift.
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>

                        <h3>Christmas Gift</h3>
                <p>A Christmas gift is tax-free and deductible if the amount is less than 500 SEK including VAT.
                    However, cash does not count as a tax-free gift.</p>

                <h3>Anniversary Gift</h3>
                <p>An anniversary gift is tax-free when the company celebrates 25, 50, 75, and 100 years. The
                    maximum amount is 1500 SEK including VAT.</p>

                <h3>Memory Gift</h3>
                <p>A memory gift can be given if the employee has been at the company for at least 6 years and:

                            salary payment. In a sole trader business, it's part of the self-employed
                            contributions paid on the surplus from the results at the end of the year.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Public pension - 7% of the salary, and is part of the taxes. In a sole trader business, it's
                            part of the self-employed
                            contributions paid on the surplus from the results at the end of the year. It
                            is only earned with an annual income of at least 22,000 SEK and is maximized
                            with a monthly salary of about 50,000 SEK.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Occupational pension - 4.5 - 6% of the salary, and 30% on salary exceeding a around 46,000
                            SEK monthly. It's not included in the employer or self-employed
                            contributions, hence you as a business owner need to cover it.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        If you run a sole trader business and have a surplus of less than 599,250 SEK before
                        tax (2023), it's recommended not to deduct for Pension Costs since you would reduce
                        the surplus which in turn lowers the public pension. Therefore, it's better not to
                        make a deduction and instead save privately in an Investment Savings Account (ISK).
                    </p>
                </blockquote>

                <h3>Deduction</h3>
                <p>If you want to compensate for the part of the occupational pension you miss as a
                    self-employed, you can deduct for pension savings you make through the company. You may be
                    entitled to a deduction for your own pension savings if the savings are made through a
                    pension insurance or individual pension savings (IPS).</p> 
                <p>To be entitled to a full deduction, pension costs must not exceed 35% of the earning salary
                    for the specific employee. There's also a max limit of 573,000 SEK
                    (2024).</p> 
                <p>The tax is 24.26% on the pension costs. The tax is also deductible and considered a cost in
                    the company's results.</p>

                        <h2>Salary / Withdrawal</h2>
                <p>If you run a limited liability company (aktiebolag), there are two ways to withdraw money: salary or
                    dividend. In a sole
                    trader business (enskild näringsverksamhet), withdrawals can be made without tax consequences.
                    Taxation occurs on the
                    surplus/result instead.</p>
                <p>Salary costs are deductible, but there are more costs than just the salary payment. Costs to
                    consider when paying a salary:</p>
                <ul class="deduct-list">
                    <li>
                        <p>Monthly salary</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Vacation pay (12%)</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Employer contributions/tax (31.42%)</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Contract insurance</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Special payroll tax on pension payments</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Other benefits</p>
                    </li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>Vacation pay is 12% by law and is based on a vacation entitlement of 25 days. If the employee
                    is entitled to more vacation days, the percentage rate increases.</p>
                <p>Employer contributions are normally 31.42%. If the employee is older than 66 years or younger
                    than 18 years and earns less than 25,000 SEK per month, the employer contributions are
                    10.21%.</p>
                <p>If you, as a business owner, are connected to a collective agreement, contract insurance must
                    be signed, and therefore a payroll tax must be paid on a certain part of the insurance. If
                    you are not connected to a collective agreement, you can choose whether you want to sign
                    insurance. Benefits in both cases are not mandatory and can be opted out.</p>
