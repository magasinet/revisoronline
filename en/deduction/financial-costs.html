            <p>This section covers deductible financial expenses such as bank fees, interest rates, and other costs related to your business operations. Learn about the regulations for deducting these expenses and get tips for optimizing your tax deductions.</p>

            <h2>Bank Charges</h2>
            <p>Costs for maintaining a corporate bank account are deductible. This includes annual fees paid to the bank and additional services such as Swish payments.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>Bank Loans and Interest</h2>
            <p>Loans are not considered a cost but a liability. Therefore, a loan does not reduce profit. However, there are costs associated with a bank loan, such as administration fees and interest.</p> <br>
            <p>Interest and other expenses incurred by a bank loan are deductible.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>Loans from Shareholders and Interest</h2>
            <p>If the corporation needs to borrow money, you as a shareholder can lend to the company and receive an entitlement to interest. The interest rate should be market-based, i.e., similar to the rate other banks would charge. The interest can also be calculated as the government loan rate + 1 - 3%.</p> <br>
            <p>The interest is deductible for the company, and you as the lender are taxed personally at 30% on the interest income.</p>
